# 🎾 Pickleball.com QA Portfolio Project

As a passionate pickleball player and a dedicated QA tester, I believe every great rally begins with a perfect serve. This repository serves as my QA portfolio, documenting my mission to meticulously plan, design, and execute test cases for Pickleball.com with the same precision I bring to the court.

My test style is very different from the 

## 📋 Project Scope

his project focuses on a comprehensive, page-by-page analysis and testing of the Pickleball.com website. My process involves systematically breaking down each page and its components to create a thorough testing strategy.

### Methodology
For each page or major feature, I will perform the following:
1.  **Component Breakdown:** Deconstruct the page into its individual elements (links, buttons, dropdowns, forms, etc.).
2.  **Test Case Design:** Create detailed test cases for each component, covering functional and UI/UX validation.
3.  **Execution and Documentation:** Execute the test cases and document the results, including bug reports for any identified issues.

This approach ensures a complete and structured testing process, as demonstrated in my initial analysis of the site's header below:

#### Header Breakdown (Example)
* **header.links**
    * Shop Pickleball Central
    * Where to Watch Pickleball
    * Notifications
    * Profile Dropdown (with sub-links)
* **header.menu**
    * Microapps (with sub-links)
    * News
    * Tournaments
    * Results
    * And more...
## 📝 Project Artifacts

This repository is a collection of documents and artifacts created during the manual testing process.

* **Test Plan:** A high-level document outlining the overall testing strategy and scope.
* **Test Cases:** Detailed, step-by-step test cases for various features and user flows.
* **Bug Reports:** Documentation of identified issues, including steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and severity levels.
* **Exploratory Testing Notes:** A summary of unstructured testing sessions to uncover hidden issues.
